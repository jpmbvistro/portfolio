        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Born in the Philippines, I moved to the US at a young age. With an early interest in technology and engineering, I worked several software internships before my first year of college. Utilizing my early foundation in computer science, I established a grounding in data abstraction and discrete thinking.</p>
        <p>While investing time into my local community, I established and led a Filipinx organization, and served as a Programs Director and Program Lead for the longest-running Asian American open mic at a local nonprofit. My grassroots events averaged over 40-50 attendees and garnered the support of local marginalized communities. During my time with these organizations, I honed a reflective analysis and cultural competence in my programmatic design.</p>
        <p>I utilize these experiences to craft complex yet elegant software solutions.</p>

              <h5>Slot Machine</h5>
              <p>I made this slot machine for a coding challenge that required me to only use vanilla JS, HTML and CSS. I wanted to keep the aesthetic similar to my other projects, minimalistic with vibrant colors. Calculating the win-loss ratio was simple in of itself, but it was an interesting challenge to figure out a way to animate the reels. I decided to make a film strip behind each reel window, and randomly populate the reels from the top down. I would then loop the strip through the reel window and slow down to the top of the reel after a set delay. This resulted in a "spinning" motion which mimicked slot reels in a real machine.</p>

              <p>This project was made for a coding challenge to create a to-do list. I wanted to incorporate my brand's aesthetic into the project. I wanted to make it look like a productivity tool I would use daily.</p>

              <p>I made this color generator for a coding challenge that required me to build a horoscope using vanilla JS, HTML and CSS only. I wanted to dedicate this application to those who didn't know their birthdate or don't want to celebrate it. Also, I didn't want to make 12 outputs and instead make a simple algorithm using the inputs.</p>
